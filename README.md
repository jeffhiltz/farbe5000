# FARBE 5000

A tool for analyzing and modifying color schemes based on the [CIELAB color space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space).  CIELAB was designed so that the same amount of numerical change in its values corresponds to roughly the same amount of visually perceived change.  Using this tool you can create a color scheme that will have a balanced appearance.

## Live

## TODO

* add "delete row"
* add control over background color
* look at using [Oklab](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/) in addition (or instead of) CIELAB.
* label graphs
