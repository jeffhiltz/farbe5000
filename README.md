# Brainstorming

How do I store the state?
- how about an arbitray unique ID for each imported colour (UUID?)
- it can have an initial value and a current value
 - it can also have many derived values
 - it can have "background" flag

- so the import can dump it into a store.
o put a button on import
o add an export box with a button
 - this will do a search/replace on text from import
